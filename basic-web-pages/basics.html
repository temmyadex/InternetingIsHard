    <h1>Interneting is Easy</h1>
    <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML </p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Heading defines the outline of your site. There are six(6) level of headings </p>

    <h2>List</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a UL eleement (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each items in its own LI eleement</li>
      <li>They do not need to be in particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new OL element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But the list items are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the number increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase </p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the important of a word or phrase </p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong> </em> </p>
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
